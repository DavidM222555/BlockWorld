# Block World
Basic voxel engine project in C++. Primarily used to explore basic shader techniques and optimizations related to voxels.

I made extensive use of the following resource for getting my shaders and camera set up: https://learnopengl.com
Additionally, I made use of The Cherno's OpenGL youtube series for setting up some of my basic OpenGL shader primitives: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&ab_channel=TheCherno
